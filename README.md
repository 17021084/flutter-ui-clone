# Purpose

I made 2 screens. Because of my goal is familiar with some flutter widget, so i just focus UI.

#### Note

Because some deprecated library, we need run app with flag "--no-sound-null-safety"

```bash
 flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```
or add local config for vscode. Make  ```.vscode/setting.json```
```json 

{
    "dart.flutterAdditionalArgs": [
        "--no-sound-null-safety"
    ],
} 

```

# Result

- **_Home_**
  <img src ="./demo_ui/home.png">

- **_Detail_**
  <img src ="./demo_ui/details.png">
